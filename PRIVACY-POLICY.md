**Foreword / Disclaimer**

The following is the original privacy policy for the Another Widget app built by Tommaso Berlose. I (some Internet nobody) have taken this app and modified it in accordance with the [LICENCE](https://github.com/tommasoberlose/another-widget/blob/main/LICENSE) outlined in the original code. My main goal with this project is to remove all tracking, crash analysis, Google Play Services, invasive and unnecessary permissions, and non-[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) code.

Whether I have succeeded is for you to decide. If you think I succeeded, great! Feel free to use my modified version of the app. If you think I've failed/missed something, please let me know by opening a github issue.

As a general rule, there should be no: information collected, data logged, cookies used or third-parties. However, I am only some nobody on the Internet and I am not perfect. For that reason, I have left the original privacy policy so that you can inspect and verify this project's code.

For easier reading and to avoid confusion, I have changed pronouns/titles such as: I, we, us, etc... to neutral ones such as: they, them, their, etc... I have also *italicized* these changes to indicate where I have modified the original document.

To be extra clear, the following was not written by me and relates entirely to Tommaso Berlose and their original app.
