# Another Widget 🕰️

This is an Android app that allows you to create a custom widget how *you* like.

## Getting Started 🛫

Currently, there is no easy way to use this version of the app. This will change once the changes I have made are stable enough to use.
In the meantime, if you are familiar with Android Studio, see the [build instructions](#build-instructions-) to build and use the app.

## Current Features 🔆

* Removed Firebase and Google Play Services usage 🔥

## Upcoming (hopefully 🤞) Features 📅

* Review existing features from a FOSS and privacy perspective 🔍
* Optimize permissions 🎛️
* Update UI to compensate for missing content ✨
* Multiple, different widgets? (if it's even possible) 📚

## Build Instructions 🧩
