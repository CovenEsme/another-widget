# Another Widget üï∞Ô∏è

This is an Android app that allows you to create a custom widget how *you* like.

## Getting Started üõ´

Currently, there is no easy way to use this version of the app. This will change once the changes I have made are stable enough to use.
In the meantime, if you are familiar with Android Studio, see the [build instructions](#build-instructions-) to build and use the app.

## Current Features üîÜ

* Removed Firebase and Google Play Services usage üî•

## Upcoming (hopefully ü§û) Features üìÖ

* Review existing features from a FOSS and privacy perspective üîç
* Optimize permissions üéõÔ∏è
* Update UI to compensate for missing content ‚ú®
* Multiple, different widgets? (if it's even possible) üìö
